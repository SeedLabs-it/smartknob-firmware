# Contributing to Seedlabs' SmartKnob firmware. 

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to the SmartKnob Firmware. 
We just got started, and there is a lot of work to do.

If you are not a developer we recommend trying to help with the documentation. 
If you are a developer and have a Seedlabs' SmartKnob, or are very familiar with the ESP32 architecture, you can get started by looking at the code and improve the code readability (small refactoring, inline documentation, etc). 
Once you gain familiarity with the codebase, head into the ISSUES tab in github and see if there is any issue that has been confirmed by the core team that you want to try to tackle, otherwise, you can join our discord server and ask in the [firmware channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176446753764032532/1194936210959896627) if there are any tasks you can work on.


The process is straight-forward.

 - Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#best-practices-for-faster-reviews) by Kubernetes (but skip step 0 and 1)
 - Fork this repo
 - Code/Write.
 - Ensure tests work.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**](https://github.com/SeedLabs-it/smartknob-firmware/tree/dev) branch of the SmartKnob Firmware.

 

## Feature suggestions

If you want to suggest a new feature for our Firmware (e.g., new integrations, UI improvement), please open an issue with the tag Feature request, the core team will come back to you on it.
